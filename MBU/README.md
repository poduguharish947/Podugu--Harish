# Or run mongod manually
mongod
```

## Environment Variables

PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/userdb
```

## Project Structure

```
backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js        # Main server file

## Next Steps

To connect the frontend with this backend:
1. Make sure the backend server is running
2. Update the frontend JavaScript to make API calls instead of using localStorage
3. Open the updated `Project.html` in your browser

## Troubleshooting

**MongoDB Connection Error:**
- Ensure MongoDB is installed and running
- Check the connection string in `.env` file

**Port Already in Use:**
- Change the PORT in `.env` file
- Or stop the process using port 3000
